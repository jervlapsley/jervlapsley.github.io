Hello Brewers!

This blog post will cover how I plan to pass Cisco CCNA 200–301 certification exam.

Whenever I’ve decided to pursue a certification exam, part of my process includes extensive research and study planning. I create a study plan, schedule my exam, then get my head down in my studies.

I’m a visual and hands-on learner, so I look for 2 study resources, usually a video course and a book to reference for a more in-depth point of view. I also gather other supplementary resources to fill in gaps to get a deeper understanding of specific technologies.

The main goal when pursuing certification exams; is to pass on the first try, obtain knowledge and get a return on investment — failure is good, but these exams are fucking expensive.

Below I’ve shared my extensive 4–5 months study plan and study resources. All the best on your journey!
